          Since beginning my journey as a developer nearly 2 years ago, I've
          done remote <br /> work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
          collaborated with talented people to <br /> create website for use.
          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and <br /> perpetually
          working on improving my skills.
